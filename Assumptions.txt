Bitmap indexing
1) The database records are stored sequentially so that when we create a bitmap, we only need one seek to get to the first entry and then all the entries are read by simply incrementing the pointer.
2) The RAM has enough storage to store the bitmap for an entire column worth so that the entire bitmap can be calculated one by one and then written to disk only once.
3) The bitmaps are stored in a different partition whose block can only store x bits whereas the database entries are stored in a different partition where y tuples per block are stored. This is done due to the variable size of the database entries and for ease of simulation.



B+Tree indexing
1) There are no duplicate values in the database.
2) All the entries of a leaf node are stored in the same data block.
